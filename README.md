## Sentiment Analysis Program
This is a Python program that performs sentiment analysis on text data. The program reads a dataset of reviews from a CSV file, pre-processes the text data, and creates a bag-of-words model for classification. It then trains three different Naive Bayes models on the data and tests their accuracy, ultimately selecting the Bernoulli Naive Bayes model as the best performer. The program saves this model for future use in analyzing new text data.
